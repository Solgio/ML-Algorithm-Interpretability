== Stage idea

The internship project is centered around the exploration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, with a specific focus on the interpretability and comprehensibility of machine learning algorithms. The primary objective is to analyze a variety of predictive models, ranging from basic regression and classification algorithms to more complex ensemble methods, in order to evaluate their transparency and explainability. 
The idea is to increase the undestanding of the results of the models, and to make them more accessible to non-expert stakeholders, by leveraging advanced Prompt Engineering principles to develop tailored prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) that can automatically generate human-readable explanations of algorithmic behaviors and predictions.

The timeline of the project is structured as follows:

== Project goals
The goals follow a notation to distinguish between necessary (N), desirable (D) and optional (O) goals.
In the planning phase the goals were defined as follows:
